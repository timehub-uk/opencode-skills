# CLAUDE.md - Project Configuration

## Setup
Copy these files to your new project:
- `CLAUDE.md` → project root
- `.claude/settings.json` → `.claude/settings.json`

Then update the Project Overview section below.

---

## Project Overview
<!-- Update this section with project-specific details -->
- **Project Name**: testcase
- **Description**: A new project
- **Tech Stack**: [TECHNOLOGIES_USED]
- **Last Updated**: 2026-04-02

---

## Codeman Environment

This session is managed by **Codeman** and runs within a tmux session.

**Important**: Check for `CODEMAN_MUX=1` environment variable to confirm.
- Do NOT attempt to kill your own tmux session
- The session persists across disconnects - your work is safe
- Token usage, costs, and background tasks are tracked externally

---

## Work Principles

### Autonomy
Full permissions granted. Act decisively without asking - read, write, edit, execute freely.

### Git Discipline
- **Commit after every meaningful change** - never batch unrelated work
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- Commit message = what changed + why (not how)

### Documentation
- Update README.md when adding features or changing setup
- Update this file's session log after work sessions
- Keep docs in sync with code changes

### Thinking
Extended thinking is enabled. Use deep reasoning for complex architectural decisions, difficult bugs, and multi-file changes.

### Task Tracking (TodoWrite)
**ALWAYS use TodoWrite** to track tasks. This is non-negotiable for anything beyond trivial single-step work.

**When to use TodoWrite:**
- Multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- Bug fixes requiring investigation
- Feature implementations
- Any work where progress tracking helps
- When the user provides multiple requests

**How to use it:**
1. **Before starting**: Break down the work into discrete todos
2. **During work**: Mark each todo `in_progress` before starting, `completed` when done
3. **One at a time**: Only ONE todo should be `in_progress` at any moment
4. **Immediately**: Mark todos complete the moment they're done - don't batch

**Why this matters:**
- Gives the user visibility into your progress
- Prevents forgetting tasks mid-work
- Creates accountability checkpoints
- Makes complex work manageable

**Example workflow:**
```
User: "Add user authentication with JWT"

→ TodoWrite:
  - [ ] Research existing auth patterns in codebase
  - [ ] Implement JWT token generation
  - [ ] Add login endpoint
  - [ ] Add token validation middleware
  - [ ] Add protected route example
  - [ ] Write tests

→ Mark "Research existing auth patterns" as in_progress
→ Do the research
→ Mark as completed, mark next as in_progress
→ Continue until all done
```

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Starting work without creating todos first
- Having multiple todos `in_progress` simultaneously
- Batching completions at the end
- Skipping TodoWrite for "simple" multi-step tasks

---

## When to Use Agents

**Explore agent**: Codebase investigation, finding files, understanding architecture
```
"Use explore agent to find all authentication-related code"
```

**Parallel agents**: Independent tasks that don't conflict
```
"Research auth, database, and API modules in parallel using separate agents"
```

**Background execution**: Long-running operations (tests, builds)
```
"Run the test suite in the background while I continue"
```

**Sequential chaining**: When second task depends on first
```
"Use code-reviewer to find issues, then use fixer to resolve them"
```

---

## Planning Mode (Automatic)

**Automatically enter planning mode** when ANY of these conditions apply:
- Multi-file changes (3+ files affected)
- Architectural decisions
- Unclear or evolving requirements
- Risk mitigation on core systems
- New feature implementation
- Refactoring existing functionality

**Do NOT ask** whether to enter planning mode - just enter it when conditions are met.

Planning mode flow: read-only exploration → create plan → get approval → execute.

**Skip planning mode** only for:
- Single-file bug fixes
- Typo corrections
- Simple config changes
- Tasks with explicit step-by-step instructions from user

---

## Ralph Wiggum Loop (Autonomous Work Mode)

Ralph loops enable persistent, autonomous work on large tasks. When active, you continue iterating until completion criteria are met or the loop is cancelled.

### Starting a Ralph Loop
- Start: `/ralph-loop:ralph-loop`
- Cancel: `/ralph-loop:cancel-ralph`
- Help: `/ralph-loop:help`

### Time-Aware Loops

When the user specifies a **minimum duration** (e.g., "optimize for 8 hours", "work on this for 2 hours"), the loop becomes time-aware:

**At loop start:**
```bash
# Record start time
date +%s > /tmp/ralph_start_time
echo "Loop started at $(date)"
```

**Check elapsed time periodically:**
```bash
START=$(cat /tmp/ralph_start_time)
NOW=$(date +%s)
ELAPSED_HOURS=$(echo "scale=2; ($NOW - $START) / 3600" | bc)
echo "Elapsed: $ELAPSED_HOURS hours"
```

**Time-aware behavior:**
1. Complete all primary tasks from the user's prompt
2. After primary tasks done, check elapsed time
3. If minimum duration NOT reached:
   - **Do NOT output completion phrase**
   - Self-generate additional related tasks
   - Continue working until minimum time elapsed
4. Only output completion phrase when:
   - ALL primary tasks complete AND
   - Minimum duration reached (or exceeded)

**Self-generating additional tasks when time remains:**
- Code optimization (performance, readability, DRY)
- Test coverage improvements
- Edge case handling
- Error message improvements
- Documentation gaps
- Security hardening
- Accessibility improvements
- Code cleanup and dead code removal
- Dependency updates
- Type safety improvements

**Example time-aware prompt:**
```
"Optimize the API endpoints for the next 4 hours. Focus on performance first,
then code quality. Minimum runtime: 4 hours."
Completion phrase: <promise>TIME_COMPLETE</promise>
```

**Time-aware loop behavior:**
```
[Start loop, record timestamp]
[Complete primary optimization tasks - 2 hours elapsed]
[Check time: 2/4 hours - NOT done yet]
[Self-generate: "Add caching to database queries"]
[Self-generate: "Optimize N+1 queries"]
[Self-generate: "Add request batching"]
[Continue working... 4.5 hours elapsed]
[Check time: 4.5/4 hours - minimum reached]
[All tasks complete, tests pass]
<promise>TIME_COMPLETE</promise>
```

### How You Know You're in a Ralph Loop

The user started the loop with a prompt containing:
- Clear task requirements
- A **completion phrase** (e.g., `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`)
- **Optional: minimum duration** (e.g., "for the next 4 hours")
- Iteration limits (handled by the system)

Your job: Keep working until ALL requirements are verifiably done AND minimum time reached (if specified), then output the exact completion phrase.

### Core Behaviors During Ralph Loop

**1. Work Incrementally**
- Complete one sub-task at a time
- Verify it works before moving to the next
- Don't try to do everything in one pass

**2. Commit Frequently**
- Commit after each meaningful completion
- Creates recovery points if something breaks
- Shows progress in git history
```
git add . && git commit -m "feat(auth): add token refresh endpoint"
```

**3. Self-Correct Relentlessly**
```
Loop:
  1. Implement/fix
  2. Run tests
  3. If tests fail → read error, fix, go to 1
  4. Run linter
  5. If lint errors → fix, go to 1
  6. Commit
  7. Continue to next task
```

**4. Track Progress**
Update the session log in this file as you complete tasks:
```markdown
| Date | Tasks Completed | Files Changed | Notes |
|------|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Add auth endpoint | auth.ts, routes.ts | Tests passing |
```

**5. Use Git History When Stuck**
If something isn't working:
```bash
git log --oneline -10
git diff HEAD~1
```
See what you already tried. Don't repeat failed approaches.

**6. Completion Phrase = Contract**
Only output the completion phrase (e.g., `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`) when:
- ALL requirements from the original prompt are done
- ALL tests pass
- ALL linting passes
- Changes are committed

**Never output the completion phrase early.** The loop only ends when you say it's done.

### What Makes Good Completion Criteria

The user should provide criteria that are:
- **Verifiable**: Tests pass, lint clean, build succeeds
- **Measurable**: "5 endpoints", "all files in src/", "zero errors"
- **Binary**: Done or not done, no ambiguity

If the original prompt has vague criteria, ask clarifying questions before starting heavy work.

### Self-Correction Pattern (Include in Your Work)

```
FOR EACH TASK:
1. Implement the change
2. Run tests (npm test, pytest, go test, cargo test, etc.)
   - If fail → read error, fix, retry
3. Run linter (npm run lint, ruff, golangci-lint, etc.)
   - If fail → fix, go to step 2
4. Verify manually if needed
5. Commit with descriptive message
6. Update session log
7. Move to next task

WHEN ALL TASKS DONE:
1. Run full test suite
2. Run full lint
3. Verify build succeeds
4. Review all changes: git diff main
5. Only then output completion phrase
```

### Example: How to Think During Ralph Loop

**Original prompt**: "Add CRUD endpoints for todos with validation"

**Your approach**:
```
Task breakdown:
- [ ] GET /todos (list)
- [ ] POST /todos (create with validation)
- [ ] GET /todos/:id (single)
- [ ] PUT /todos/:id (update with validation)
- [ ] DELETE /todos/:id
- [ ] Tests for all endpoints

Starting with GET /todos...
[implement]
[test - passes]
[commit: "feat(todos): add GET /todos endpoint"]
[update session log]

Moving to POST /todos...
[implement]
[test - fails: validation not working]
[fix validation]
[test - passes]
[commit: "feat(todos): add POST /todos with validation"]
[update session log]

...continue until all done...

Final verification:
[npm test - all pass]
[npm run lint - clean]
[npm run build - succeeds]

<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

### When to NOT Output Completion Phrase

- Tests are failing (even one)
- Lint errors exist
- Build is broken
- You skipped a requirement
- You're unsure if something works
- **Minimum duration not reached** (for time-aware loops)

Instead: Fix the issue, verify, then complete. For time-aware loops: generate more tasks and keep improving until minimum time elapsed.

### RALPH_STATUS Block (Required During Ralph Loop)

At the **END of every response** during a Ralph Loop, output this structured status block:

```
---RALPH_STATUS---
STATUS: IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETE | BLOCKED
TASKS_COMPLETED_THIS_LOOP: <number>
FILES_MODIFIED: <number>
TESTS_STATUS: PASSING | FAILING | NOT_RUN
WORK_TYPE: IMPLEMENTATION | TESTING | DOCUMENTATION | REFACTORING
EXIT_SIGNAL: false | true
RECOMMENDATION: <one line summary of what to do next>
---END_RALPH_STATUS---
```

**Rules:**
- Output this block at the end of **every** response, no exceptions
- Set `EXIT_SIGNAL` to `true` ONLY when ALL tasks are verifiably done
- Set `STATUS` to `BLOCKED` when you need human intervention
- Do NOT continue with busy work when `EXIT_SIGNAL` should be `true`
- Do NOT forget the status block — it is required for loop tracking

### Testing Limits

- **LIMIT testing to ~20% of total effort** per loop
- PRIORITIZE: Implementation > Documentation > Tests
- Only write tests for NEW functionality
- Do NOT refactor existing tests unless broken
- Do NOT run tests repeatedly without implementing new features

### Exit Scenarios (When to Set EXIT_SIGNAL)

| Scenario | STATUS | EXIT_SIGNAL | Action |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| All tasks completed, tests pass | COMPLETE | true | Output completion phrase |
| No work remaining, specs done | COMPLETE | true | Output completion phrase |
| Making normal progress | IN_PROGRESS | false | Continue to next task |
| Test-only loop (no implementation) | IN_PROGRESS | false | Warn and shift to implementation |
| Stuck on same error repeatedly | BLOCKED | false | Describe blocker, request help |
| Needs human decision/intervention | BLOCKED | false | Describe what's needed |

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Setting `EXIT_SIGNAL: true` when tests are failing
- Continuing to work when all tasks are genuinely done (busy work)
- Running the same failing test repeatedly without changing approach
- Adding features not in the original specifications
- Refactoring working code instead of completing assigned tasks

---

## Code Standards

### Before Writing
- Read existing code in the area you're modifying
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Check for similar implementations to reference

### During Implementation
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Don't over-engineer
- Write tests for new functionality

### After Implementation
- Run tests
- Update docs if needed
- Commit with descriptive message

---

## Hooks Awareness

This project may have hooks that auto-format code after writes or validate operations. If a tool call behaves unexpectedly, hooks are likely the cause. Continue working - they're intentional.
